# 🧠 Comparison between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that is part of the **"Introducing Generative AI with AWS"** course from Udacity, specifically in the **"Fundamentals of AI and ML"** module. In this notebook, we explore the key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning methods in Machine Learning.

## Repository Contents 📁

- `Supervised_vs_Unsupervised.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that provides a detailed comparison of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, with practical examples and theoretical explanations.

## Requirements 📋

To run the notebook, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Running the Notebook 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Raziel-jm-code/Exercise-Supervised-vs-Unsupervised.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd Exercise-Supervised-vs-Unsupervised
    ```

3. Open the notebook using Jupyter.

    ```bash
